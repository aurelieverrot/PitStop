* Aurelie, go ahead and try this since we're not pair programming. We're adding the routes to the controller files; reference the api.js file in the express-cities solution Allen gave us, plus the photo of the whiteboarding we did with Kenny. :) Do the same over on views.js and index.js, and if either of us get stuck, we can ask each other.. or whoever :)
